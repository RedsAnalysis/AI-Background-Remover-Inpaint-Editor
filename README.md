## Installation

# EASY INSTALL

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RedsAnalysis/AI-Background-Remover-Inpaint-Editor.git
cd AI-Background-Remover-Inpaint-Editor
./setup.sh
source venv/bin/activate
python app.py
```

# MANUAL INSTALL
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/RedsAnalysis/AI-Background-Remover-Inpaint-Editor.git
cd AI-Background-Remover-Inpaint-Editor
```

2. Set up a virtual environment (strongly recommended):
```bash
# On Windows
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

# On macOS/Linux
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Verify you're in the virtual environment (should show venv path)
where python  # on Windows
which python  # on macOS/Linux
```

3. Install dependencies in the virtual environment:
```bash
# Upgrade pip first (recommended)
python -m pip install --upgrade pip

# Install project dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Note: Always make sure your virtual environment is activated when working with the project. You'll know it's activated when you see `(venv)` at the beginning of your terminal prompt.

## Usage

1. Start the application:
```bash
python app.py
```

2. Open your web browser and navigate to the provided local URL (typically http://localhost:7860)

3. Upload an image using the web interface

4. Use the background removal tool to automatically remove the background

5. Fine-tune the results using the inpainting tools if needed

6. Download your processed image

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)
- Git
- 4GB+ RAM recommended for optimal performance
- CUDA-compatible GPU (optional, for faster processing)

## Development Setup

1. Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed:
```bash
python --version
```

2. Set up a virtual environment (recommended):
```bash
# On Windows
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

# On macOS/Linux
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Requirements

See requirements.txt for detailed package dependencies. Key dependencies include:
- rembg & transparent_background: For background removal
- gradio: For the web interface
- Pillow: For image processing
- torch & onnxruntime: For AI model operations

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Installation Errors**
   - Ensure you're using Python 3.8 or higher
   - Try upgrading pip: `pip install --upgrade pip`
   - If you encounter CUDA errors, make sure your GPU drivers are up to date
   - If you see "command not found" errors, ensure your virtual environment is activated
   - If pip install fails, try creating a fresh virtual environment
   - For Windows users: if `venv\Scripts\activate` fails, try using `venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1` in PowerShell

2. **Runtime Errors**
   - Check if all dependencies are properly installed
   - Verify you have sufficient RAM available
   - Ensure the virtual environment is activated (if using one)

3. **Performance Issues**
   - Consider using a GPU for faster processing
   - Close other resource-intensive applications
   - Try processing smaller images first
